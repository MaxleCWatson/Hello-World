# Hello-World
First Repository
This is my first repository on Github. My names Maxle Watson, I live in Austin, Texas. I've always been interested in computers and tech but never acted on it until I accidentally found the source code for a website about a year ago. After that something hit me, I decided to start studying for my associates in CS. I never coded until about 2.5-3 months ago on an app on my phone. Now i'm here. Enjoy my journey with me.
